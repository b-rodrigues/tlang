That is the perfect question to ask right now. With all these components—the core language, the C++ FFI bridge, the Nix-based packaging, and the user-facing libraries—a well-organized project structure is absolutely essential.

The best structure will be a **monorepo** that is clearly organized into distinct, self-contained components. This allows for unified tooling and issue tracking while maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

Here is the blueprint for the ideal project structure for T.

### Explanation of Key Design Choices

1.  **Top-Level `flake.nix`:** This is the "one command to rule them all." A new developer will clone the repo, run `nix develop`, and have the correct versions of OCaml, Dune, CMake, GCC, and the Arrow C++ library ready to go.

2.  **Modular OCaml Workspace (`src/`):**
    *   The `src/` directory is an OCaml "workspace" managed by Dune.
    *   The language has been broken down into small, focused libraries (`t_core`, `t_parser`, `t_arrow_bridge`, `t_eval`). This is excellent for managing dependencies. For example, `t_parser` depends on `t_core`, and `t_eval` depends on all of them. Dune will manage this compilation hierarchy perfectly.
    *   This makes the codebase much easier to navigate and reason about than a single flat directory.

3.  **Separation of C++ and OCaml (`t_cxx_bridge/`):** The "unsafe" C++ code with its own build system (CMake) is kept completely separate from the OCaml code. The `flake.nix` will be configured to build the C++ shared library (`.so` file) first, and then tell Dune where to find it so the `t_arrow_bridge` can link against it. This is a clean and standard polyglot architecture.

4.  **Standard Library as OCaml (`stdlib/`):** The T standard library functions are implemented as a set of OCaml libraries. This is where the wrappers around the Arrow bridge will live. It is distinct from the core compiler in `src/`.

5.  **Tests Written in T (`tests/t/`):** The primary way to test the language is to write tests *in the language itself*. The `t test` command will be configured to discover and run these `.t` files, making it a self-hosting test suite.

This project structure is professional, scalable, and clearly communicates the architecture of the system. It provides a clean separation between the language's core, its native C++ backend, its standard library, and its testing infrastructure. This is the right foundation for building a serious language.
