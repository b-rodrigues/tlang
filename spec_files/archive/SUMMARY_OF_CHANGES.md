## Key Insights from Analysis

### What's Already Complete (Alpha v0.1 - 96%)
- ✅ Core language features (pipes, closures, error handling)
- ✅ DataFrames with CSV support
- ✅ Six core data verbs + window functions
- ✅ Pipeline DAG execution
- ✅ Math/statistics including linear regression
- ✅ Intent blocks for LLM collaboration
- ✅ REPL and CLI
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and tests

### What's Missing for Alpha
- ❌ Arrow backend optimization (performance penalty on large datasets)
- ❌ Edge case testing (grouped ops, large datasets)
- ❌ Final documentation polish
- ❌ Release preparation

### What's Missing for Beta
- ❌ Package management tooling (designed but not implemented)
- ❌ Parallel pipeline execution
- ❌ Enhanced intent blocks and LLM tooling
- ❌ Pattern matching, lenses
- ❌ Joins, pivots, multiple file formats
- ❌ Editor support (VS Code, LSP)

## Differentiating Features Emphasized

Both documents emphasize T's unique value propositions:

1. **Perfect Reproducibility via Nix**
   - Decentralized package ecosystem
   - Date-pinned dependencies
   - Zero dependency hell
   - Works identically years later

2. **Production-Grade Pipelines**
   - DAG-based execution
   - Automatic parallelization
   - Smart caching
   - Workflow engine integration

3. **LLM-Native Development**
   - Structured intent blocks
   - Machine-readable metadata
   - AI-assisted code generation
   - Human-AI collaboration workflows

These are the features that make T different from R, Python, or other data analysis languages.

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate (Alpha Completion - 3 weeks)
1. Arrow backend optimization
2. Edge case hardening
3. Documentation polish
4. Release preparation

### Short-term (Beta Phase 1 - Months 1-2)
1. Package management tooling
2. Pattern matching
3. Parallel pipeline execution

### Medium-term (Beta Phase 2-3 - Months 3-6)
1. Enhanced LLM integration
2. Data features (joins, pivots, Parquet)
3. Developer tooling (VS Code, LSP)

### Long-term (Beta Phase 4+ - Months 7-8)
1. Performance optimization
2. Statistical enhancements
3. Final beta polish

## Next Steps

For **Alpha Completion**:
1. Read FINISH_ALPHA.md
2. Start with Week 1: Arrow Backend
3. Track daily progress
4. Ship Alpha v0.1.0 in 3 weeks

For **Beta Planning**:
1. Read BETA.md
2. Prioritize package ecosystem work
3. Begin Phase 1 after Alpha release
4. Ship Beta v0.2.0 in Q3 2026

## Document Relationships

```
ROADMAP.md (high-level vision)
    ├── ALPHA.md (what alpha achieved)
    ├── FINISH_ALPHA.md (how to complete alpha) ← NEW
    └── BETA.md (what beta will achieve) ← NEW
```

These documents complement the existing roadmap by providing:
- **FINISH_ALPHA.md**: Concrete implementation steps for alpha
- **BETA.md**: Detailed planning for beta features

## Questions Addressed

The documents answer key questions from the original issue:
