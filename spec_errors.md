### Analysis of the "Print-and-Return-None" Model

*   **Proposal:** `x = sqrt(-1)` prints `"Can't compute..."` and `x` becomes `None`.
*   **Strength:** It's very simple for the interactive REPL user. They get immediate feedback.
*   **Fatal Flaw:** The error message is completely disconnected from the result. The value `None` contains no information about *why* the operation failed. A program cannot distinguish between `sqrt(-1)` and `read_csv("missing.csv")`. Both just produce `None`, making it impossible to handle different errors in different ways. This prevents programmatic error handling.

Your instinct about `.errormsg` is the key to solving this. If a value needs to carry an error message, it **cannot be `None`**. It must be a different kind of object: an **Error object**.

This leads us to the "errors as values" philosophy, which is the gold standard for robust functional programming and data pipelines.

### The Best UX: First-Class Error Values

The most powerful and user-friendly system is to treat errors as their own special, structured data type. This gives the user full control.

#### 1. Creation: Errors are Values
When an operation fails, it returns an `Error` value. This value is a piece of data, just like a number or a string.

```t
-- This does NOT print anything.
-- It returns a value and assigns it to x.
x = sqrt(-1)

-- x now holds the value: Error({message: "Domain Error: Cannot compute...", code: 101})
```

#### 2. Checking: A Simple Predicate
The user needs an easy way to check if a result was successful. A built-in function is the cleanest way.

```t
y = some_operation()

if is_error(y) {
  -- ... handle the error ...
} else {
  -- ... use the successful result ...
}```

#### 3. Programmatic Handling: Accessing Metadata
This is the feature you correctly identified as necessary. An `Error` value is a structured object (like a `Dict`), so you can access its contents using dot notation.

```t
if is_error(y) {
  -- The user decides WHEN and HOW to show the error.
  print("Operation failed! Reason: " + y.message)

  -- The user can even react to specific error codes.
  if y.code == 404 {
    print("File was not found.")
  }
}
```

#### 4. Propagation: Errors "Poison" Pipelines
`Error` values automatically propagate through computations. The `Error` value is passed along, and subsequent operations do nothing. This keeps pipelines clean.

```t
-- The sqrt() fails and returns an Error value.
-- The `+ 5` and `* 10` operations see the Error and just pass it through.
-- The final result is the ORIGINAL Error from sqrt().
result = sqrt(-1) + 5 * 10

print(result)
-- Output: Error: Domain Error: Cannot compute the square root of a negative number.
```

#### 5. Display: The REPL and `print()` are Error-Aware
The REPL and the `print()` function know how to format `Error` values nicely. They are only displayed when the user explicitly asks to see the value. This puts the user in control and avoids noisy, unexpected output during a long pipeline run.

### Specification Paragraph for Easy Copy & Pasting

Here is a paragraph for your specification that formalizes this superior "First-Class Error Value" model.

### Error Semantics: Errors as First-Class Values

T handles runtime failures using a "first-class error value" model. Instead of throwing exceptions or returning a simple `Null`/`None` value, a failed operation returns a structured `Error` object. This value contains metadata about the failure, such as a descriptive `.message` and an optional `.code`, making errors fully programmable. This approach ensures that no information is lost and gives the user complete control over error handling. Errors propagate ("poison") subsequent operations in a pipeline, and are only displayed when explicitly printed, preventing unexpected side effects. A built-in predicate, `is_error(x)`, allows for robust, programmatic checking and handling of failures. 


You are absolutely right. My apologies. The `try` block is an unnecessary complication that adds imperative-style control flow.

Your original vision is purer and more functional: **the function call itself is the boundary**. If it fails, its return value *is* the error object. This is a cleaner and more powerful semantic.

Here is the revised, superior specification paragraph that reflects this direct, functional approach.

### ðŸ§ª Error Semantics: Errors as First-Class Objects

In T, errors are not exceptions that crash a program, nor are they simple strings. Errors are first-class, structured data objects that can be assigned to variables, passed to functions, and programmatically inspected. When a function call fails, its return value **is** an `Error` object.

This `Error` object is represented as a standard T `Dict` with a consistent structure:

*   **`message`**: A human-readable string explaining what went wrong.
*   **`code`**: A machine-readable `Symbol` that categorizes the error (e.g., `#FileNotFound`, `#TypeError`, `#IndexOutOfBounds`), allowing for reliable programmatic handling.
*   **`location`**: An optional `Dict` containing the file, line, and column where the error occurred.
*   **`trace`**: An optional `List` of strings representing the function call stack leading to the error.
*   **`context`**: An optional `Dict` containing extra data relevant to the error (e.g., the invalid index that was used, or the expected vs. actual types in a `TypeError`).

This design allows for robust, functional error handling using standard conditional logic. A built-in predicate, `is_error()`, is used to check if a returned value is an `Error` object.

```t
-- The function call to read_csv is made directly.
let result = read_csv("missing.csv")

-- The return value 'result' is either a DataFrame on success, or an Error object on failure.
if is_error(result) {
  print("Operation failed!")
  print("Reason: " + result.message)

  if result.code == #FileNotFound {
    -- Attempt a fallback action, like returning an empty DataFrame.
    DataFrame()
  } else {
    -- Propagate the error if we can't handle it.
    result
  }
} else {
  -- Continue the pipeline on the successful result.
  result |> filter(age > 30)
}```
Users can also create their own custom errors within their functions using a built-in `error()` constructor, making it possible to write robust libraries and applications in T.
